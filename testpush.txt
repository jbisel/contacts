Story refinement
- not all actors are end users
- how big should a user story be
--stories too big are considered epics (our user stories are features)
- acceptance criteria
-- only start adding acceptance criteria when 20% confidence it can get done in a sprint
-- the different team members help come up with well rounded scenarios, PO Architect UX and QA
-- team doesn't come in until we get to 50%-80% confident the US can get accomplished in a sprint
- should have about 9 iterations worth of backlog
- scenarios are excellent ways to delimit the stories
